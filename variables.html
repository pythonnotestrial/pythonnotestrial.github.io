										<h1>Variables & Functions</h1>
									</header>

									
									<hr class="major" />
									<p>A variable is a named value that references or stores a piece of data.
										Variables can be assigned by using an “=” sign, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>x=5
x = 5
print(x)    # x evaluates to 5
print(x*2)  # evaluates to 10
y = 5
print(y==x) # evaluates to true
</code></pre>
<p>Variable names must start with a letter and cannot contain special characters. </p>
<p>Variables can be updated with operations and can assume different data types.
	The operations available to each variable differ based on data type--for instance, you can't divide a "True" by "False"!
</p>

<hr class="major" />
<h2>Statements & Expressions</h2>
<p>An expression is a combination of symbols that represent a value. Examples:</p>
<pre><code>10            # numbers
"A"           # characters
"Jesse Chan"  # strings
1 + 2 
10 / 5        # combinations of numbers
True or False # Booleans
(25 > 3)      # this evaluates to True, which is a Boolean
</code></pre>
<p>Statements are lines of code that perform actions. Statements may be made up of expressions. Examples:</p>
<pre><code>x = 4
text = "Bob" + "the" + "Builder"
print(text) # this shows "Bob the Builder"
</code></pre>

<hr class="major" />
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>A function is a named part of a program that performs some procedure. The format in which we declare functions in Python is shown below.</p>
<pre><code>def function_name(parameters): # this is the header
	# this is where my body would go...if I had one
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that functions are made up of three elements: a name, parameters, and some action (the body). 
	The header is made up of the name and parameters. We separate the header and body with a newline and 
	an indent--most Python programmers use tabs to indent.
</p>
<p>Note that functions don't necessarily need to have any parameters at all! 
	This is done if nothing is included between the parantheses.
</p>
<p>A return statement, well, returns a value as part of a function. 
	This ends a function immediately.
	If a function has no return statement, it will return None.
	An example of a function that multiples two numbers:</p>
<pre><code>def multiply(x, y):   # declare a function using "def". This function's name
		      # is "multiply", and it takes in two parameters, x and y
	return x * y  # this function multiplies x and y
print(multiply(2, 3)) # this shows 2*3, which is 6
</code></pre>
<p>A lot of newbies in Python will confuse print() and return. 
	print() is a function that shows, in the console, what you put between the brackets.
	return is just a statement, so you won't see it unless you print it. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>def add(x, y):
	print(x + y)    # this function prints the sum of x and y, but doesn't return anything
add(3, 7) 		# we see that "10" gets printed to the console
print(add(3, 7)) 	# again, "10" is printed, but so is "None"! That's because we're not returning anything,
		 	# so when we print the result of add(3, 7), there's no result to print!
</code></pre>

<hr class="major" />
<h2>Local vs. Global Variables</h2>
<p>Variables are defined within a specific scope--this means that they can't be used everywhere in your code, but only where you define them.</p>
<p>A local variable is one that is defined inside a function, and hence only exist inside that function. An example:</p>
<pre><code>def wow():
	x = 5
	y = 3
	return x + y
print(wow()) # this shows x+y, which is 8
# the following two statements yield errors, since you never declared x and y outside of a function!
print(x) 
print(y)
</code></pre>

<span class="image fit"><img src="images/variables.png" alt="" /></span>

<p>A global variable is the complete opposite--it is declared outside functions, and can be used anywhere. Usually, it is good style to not use global variables, because 
	it would "pollute the global namespace", making it difficult to keep track of the scope of variables.
</p>
<pre><code>z = 1 # global variable
def wow():
	x = 5 # local variable
	y = 3 # local variable
	return x + y + z
print(wow()) # this shows x+y+z, which is 9
# this is fine, since z can be used outside a function!
print(z) 
</code></pre>

<hr class="major" />
<h2>Helper Functions</h2>
<p>You can call functions inside other functions! 
	These are typically called helper functions, and are quite nice in implementing more advanced algorithms.
</p>
<pre><code>def add(x, y):
	return x + y
def multiply(x, y):
	return x * y
def complex_thing(x, y, z):
	return multiply(add(x, y), z)
print(complex_thing(1, 2, 3)) # this evaluates to (1+2)*3, which is 9
</code></pre>
